In this repository, I plan to develop an RL agent that is able to prove a sequence of theorems in order of increasing complexity using only a small set of tactic and theorems previously proved by the agent. This repo is a clone of LeanDojo-V2, which facilitates Lean-Python interaction. During the course of the project I will finalize details like agent architecture, encoding schema and training parameters. 

One key feature of this RL system is a Lean tactic that is able to emit possible next steps from within the Lean environment. A rough draft of this tactic exists, but it is still lacking key features, such as the ability to emit both tactics and arguments, and the ability to accept types and functions over those types as parameters.
